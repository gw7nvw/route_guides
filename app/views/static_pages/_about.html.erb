<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
In the tradiiton of Moir's Guide and Tararua Footprints 
route guides are not complete trips in 
themselves: they describe the route from one point to another, be it the ascent
of a peak, the crossing of a mountain pass, the descent of a river catchment, 
 or that saturday morning stroll in from the roadend to your favourite hut. 
<br/>
<br/>
For end to end journeys, look under trips. Build up your own trip by adding routes and places to it - just click 'Add to trip' when you are viewing them.
You can have as many trips as you want - they're in your 'Wishlist' under 'Me'. Use the tick to select which trip you want to add items to. And when they're 
complete and you've walked them - why not add a brief description and publish 
them to provide inspiration to others.
<br/>
<br/>
Route guides and trips are dry and informative - they describe the place and 
the route,  how to get there, but not how it felt to be there, not the events 
that took place.  So for a more enjoyable, descriptive read 
contribute or read trip reports and stories, and link them back to the routes 
or trips they describe.
